# forecast

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

The Forecast mobile application is designed to help civil defense professionals and citizens
promptly, quickly identify the main threats that may arise in the event of accidents at chemically hazardous facilities.
The author insists that the Forecast valve IS NOT AN OFFICIAL SOURCE of obtaining calculation data, but only helps
quickly calculate and visualize on the map the place and area of the accident, the depth of the spread of primary and secondary clouds,
the area of ZMHZ and PZHZ.
The application is very easy to use:
- fill in the indicators on the "Output data" tab;
- look at the calculation results in the tab of the same name and click "Click to plot the indicators on the map";
- go to the map and select (click with your finger) the place of the accident. Although it can be done at the beginning :-)
- if necessary, we calculate possible losses in the corresponding tabs.
If you wish, you can still find some interesting things.
